# Coding-Primes
 Code from YouTube video.
 
This is the example code used in the video Coding Primes by GroundhogGrafix.
There are 3 functions that are significant in this code:
isprime1, isprime2 and isprime3.

isprime4 was a test that I never put in the video and is probably buggy and
shouldn't be used for anything more than testing.

Code was written and compiled using Microsoft Quick C 2.5 under MS-DOS.
